# United States Geolgoical Survey Project #
## Project Overview ##
This project involves creating an interactive web-based map for visualizing global earthquake data, utilizing Leaflet and D3.js. The primary goal is to provide the United States Geological Survey (USGS) with a tool to display earthquake data in a user-friendly manner, enhancing public and governmental understanding of seismic activities.

## Key Features ##
1. Interactive Map: Implemented using Leaflet, the map offers a clear, navigable interface focused on the United States but encompassing global earthquake data.

2. Real-time Data Integration: Earthquake data is dynamically fetched from the USGS GeoJSON feed, ensuring up-to-date information.

3. Customized Markers:
-   Size: Reflects the magnitude of each earthquake, with larger markers indicating stronger earthquakes.
-   Color: Indicates the depth of earthquakes, using a gradient from green (shallow) to red (deep).

4. Information Popups: Clickable markers reveal detailed information about each earthquake, including magnitude, depth, and location.

## Technologies Used ##
-   Leaflet.js: For interactive map functionalities.
-   D3.js: For handling and visualizing data.
-   OpenStreetMap: Provides the base map layer.
-   HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For overall webpage design and interactivity.

## Purpose and Impact ##
This tool aims to enhance the USGS's ability to communicate vital information regarding seismic events to the public and relevant government bodies, ultimately aiding in educational and funding efforts related to Earth science and natural hazard preparedness.
